# LLM_Drug_Discovery_Abstract_reading_Experiment
This is the basic experiment for tokanization where we implemented basic logic for LLM for extracting required information from the abstracts
of two article. The logic was applied to the dataset of 100 absracts to get the results. That code is the institute's property until it is published.
